# Vue Searchable Select

This used [ankurk91/vue-toast-notification](https://github.com/ankurk91/vue-toast-notification) as a template.

Vue Searchable Select is just like ole Select2. It's a select box that lets users search. All you need is a search function and this library will handle the UI heavy lifting.
